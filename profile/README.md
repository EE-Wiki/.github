# 📚 「社区共建，知识开源！」

EE-Wiki 致力于成为一个免费开放且持续更新的电子行业相关知识整合站点，从模电数电基础知识，到 FPGA 开发、嵌入式开发,再到电赛、智能车赛…我们希望能够包涵电子行业所需所有知识，成为一个知识宝库。

## 参与建设

(2025-02): 目前仍处于起草阶段，欢迎感兴趣的朋友参与建设。各类文档（譬如贡献指南、站点内各学科学习路径…）的编写工作都需要帮助！

### 建设现况

- (2025-02): 将站点框架从 Mkdocs 转移至 Docusaurus

# 📚 "Build together to make knowledge open source!"

EE-Wiki is committed to become a free and open and continuously updated electronics industry-related knowledge integration site, from the Fundamentals of Digital & Analog Electronics, 
to FPGA development, embedded development, and then to the Undergraduate Electronics Design Contest, smart car racing and so on. 
We hope to be able to cover all the knowledge required by the electronics industry, to become a treasure trove of knowledge.

## Participation in Construction

(2025-02): Still in draft stage, interested parties are welcome to participate in the build. Help is needed in the preparation of various documents (e.g. contribution guidelines, learning paths for various disciplines within the site…)!

### Build Status

- (2025-02): Migrate site framework from Mkdocs to Docusaurus
